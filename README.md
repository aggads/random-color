# RandomColor

Run `npm update && npm install`
Then
Run `npm start`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Live website

> https://random-color-live.netlify.app/home

Note : will not work since the api url is not secure (http instead of https)?

## API Random Color

During my tests the colours did not always change on the app even after reloading multiple time.
It seems to 'sometimes' work on the api site but not always here.

The colour only seems to change by refreshing the page with ctrl-f5 and not with the api call.

**Api call is inside the home folder => home-service.service.ts**

**Test carried out on Chrome and Postman.**
